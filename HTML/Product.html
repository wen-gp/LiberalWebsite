        let description = "GST212W is one of the Wafer Level Packing (WLP) uncooled infrared detectors developed by Global Sensor Technology (GST). " +
        "Wafer level packaging (WLP) is the process of completing high vacuum packaging directly on the entire MEMS wafer, then scribing and cutting " +
        "to make a single infrared detector.\r\n\r\nThis long wave vanadium oxide (VOx) microbolometer focal plane array IR detector covers wavelength " +
        "from 8 to 14μm. And its resolution is 256×192 with pixel size at 12μm.\r\n\r\nThe GST212W infrared FPA detector is specially developed for " +
        "small size, light weight & low price (SWaP), which has achieved high volume production with annual output up to 1,000,000 pieces. Due to its " +
        "lightweight and low price, GST212W uncooled thermal detector can be widely used in many industries such as Thermography, Security Monitoring, " + 
        "Outdoors, AIoT, Intelligent Hardware, Smart Building, Smart Home, UAV Payloads, Epidemic Prevention, ADAS and many other new emerging markets " + 
        "like consumer electronics. \r\n\r\nUntil now, we have provided our customers with various mature and stable infrared thermal imaging solutions. " + 
        "It’s very easy for WLP ir detector sensors developed by GST to be integrated into infrared thermal camera products and greatly reduces the cost " + 
        "for customers."
